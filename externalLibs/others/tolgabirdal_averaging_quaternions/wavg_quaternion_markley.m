% Q is an Mx4 matrix of quaternions. weights is an Mx1 vector, a weight for
% each quaternion.
% Qavg is the weightedaverage quaternion
% This function is especially useful for example when clustering poses
% after a matching process. In such cases a form of weighting per rotation
% is available (e.g. number of votes), which can guide the trust towards a
% specific pose. weights might then be interpreted as the vector of votes 
% per pose.
