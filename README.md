This (mainly) Matlab based software library supports the [Motion Capture to Robot](https://github.com/klevis-a/Mocap_To_Robot) software package, which provides a set of algorithms for robotically replicating motion capture trajectories. All algorithms included in this and supporting repositories are described in the [associated PLOS One manuscript](https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0242005). Please visit the [Motion Capture to Robot](https://github.com/klevis-a/Mocap_To_Robot) repository to find the supporting user manual. The corresponding Zenodo archive (see below) provides a link to the dataset that was processed via this library. The dataset includes motion capture trajectories that were replicated on a M20-iA industrial robot, and the optical motion capture data that verify proper replication.
